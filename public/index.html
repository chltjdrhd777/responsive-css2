            “If you can learn to love yourself and all the flaws, you can love
            other people so much better. And that makes you so happy.” – Kristen
            Chenowith Why is it so difficult to love ourselves? Basically, the
            short answer to this question is that we were raised in a society
            that didn’t teach us about self-love. This may not seem very
            important to some, but self-love is one of the best things you can
            do for yourself.

            Loving yourself provides you with self-confidence, self-worth, and
            in general, you feel more positive. If you can learn to love
            yourself, you will feel happier and will learn to take better care
            of yourself. Looking in the mirror, most of us see a lot of
            different flaws and remember too many past experiences and failings
            to love ourselves. The less you love yourself, listen to yourself,
            and understand yourself, the more confused, upset, and frustrated
            you will be in life. When you begin to love yourself and continue to
            love yourself more and more each day, things slowly will be a little
            bit better in every way possible.

            Unfortunately, self-love isn’t always easy. Accepting the pain and
            allowing yourself to be honest with who you are is a big step to
            loving yourself. Forgive yourself for past actions and things you
            are ashamed of doing.

            Carrying a lot of negative emotions like jealousy, disgust, and rage
            can have a negative impact. We need to learn how to accept not only
            the emotions that create love, joy, and happiness but also the ones
            that cause fear, insecurity, and anger in our lives. While we need
            to learn how to acknowledge and accept the pain with the love,
            another step is reconciling with a cold and unopened heart. Asking
            yourself if you fully love yourself can be very difficult because
            you must accept your flaws and faults.

            Love is something we choose, the same way we choose anger, hate, or
            sadness. We have the power to forgive someone who has hurt us in the
            past. We can learn to finally heal from something when we can
            forgive. We can always choose love.
